# Sentient Agent Roadmap

## Vision
Transform the agent from a reactive chatbot into a sentient-like entity with autonomous thoughts, human-like memories, persistent personality, and proactive behavior.

---

## Phase 1: Episodic Memory System (Human-like Memory)
**Goal**: Implement autobiographical memory with emotional context, temporal awareness, and memory consolidation.

### 1.1 Episodic Memory Store
- [ ] Create `src/store/episodic_memory_store.py`
  - Timeline-based memory storage (what, when, where, who, emotional context)
  - Memory importance scoring (0-1 based on emotional intensity, recency, access frequency)
  - Associative links between memories (similar events, cause-effect chains)
  - Memory decay algorithm (importance decreases over time unless reinforced)
  - Memory consolidation (merge similar memories, strengthen patterns)

### 1.2 Memory Types
- [ ] Short-term memory (working memory, last 5-10 interactions)
- [ ] Long-term memory (consolidated, high-importance events)
- [ ] Semantic memory (facts, knowledge - existing system)
- [ ] Procedural memory (skills, how-to - existing learning system)

### 1.3 Memory Retrieval Enhancement
- [ ] Context-aware retrieval (time, emotion, relevance)
- [ ] Associative recall (one memory triggers related memories)
- [ ] Memory reconstruction (fill gaps with inference)
- [ ] Forgetting curve implementation
